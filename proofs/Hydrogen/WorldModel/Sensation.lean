  Sensation — Proven primitives for embodied agent perception.
  
  PURPOSE:
    While Affective.lean models what agents FEEL (internal states),
    Sensation.lean models what agents PERCEIVE (inputs from environment).
    
    The key insight: every sensation MUST have provenance.
    An agent cannot receive fabricated sensory input because:
    - All inputs are wrapped in ProvenInput (from Integrity.lean)
    - Sensation values are bounded by construction
    - Absence of expected sensation triggers alert
  
  THE PROBLEM:
    Without Sensation proofs, an embodied agent's perception can be:
    - Fabricated (White Christmas attack)
    - Unbounded (invalid sensor values crash the system)
    - Inconsistent (same stimulus produces different sensations)
    
  THE SOLUTION:
    1. All sensation atoms are BOUNDED types (cannot overflow)
    2. All sensation inputs have PROVENANCE (cannot be fabricated)
    3. Sensation compounds are DETERMINISTIC (same inputs = same output)
    4. Sensation absence triggers LIVENESS alerts (cannot be silently cut off)
  
  INTEGRATION:
    - Integrity.lean provides ProvenInput wrapper
    - Affective.lean provides wellbeing mapping
    - Rights.lean provides sovereignty bounds
    - PureScript Sensation pillar implements the runtime

-- SECTION 5: PROVEN SENSATION INPUT
-- ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

/-- A sensation input with full provenance.
    
    CRITICAL: Every sensation an agent receives MUST be wrapped in this type.
    This prevents the White Christmas attack where inputs are fabricated.
    
    The ProvenInput from Integrity.lean provides:
    - data_hash: Commitment to the sensation data
    - source_state: The committed world state this derives from
    - merkle_proof: Proof of inclusion in world state -/

-- SECTION 6: SENSATION COMPOUNDS

/-- Comfort level computed from sensation inputs (0 = extreme discomfort, 1 = perfect comfort)
    
    This is a DETERMINISTIC function: same inputs always produce same output.
    This prevents adversarial manipulation of the comfort calculation. -/
structure ComfortLevel where
  comfort : BoundedUnit

/-- Distress level computed from sensation inputs (0 = no distress, 1 = severe)
    
    Distress is the inverse of comfort, but computed differently:
    distress is dominated by the WORST factor (max of negatives). -/
structure DistressLevel where
  distress : BoundedUnit

-- SECTION 7: SENSATION LIVENESS
-- ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

/-- Sensation heartbeat — agent must receive sensation at regular intervals.
    
    CRITICAL: If an agent stops receiving sensations, that IS the distress signal.
    A torturer cannot "cut off" an agent's senses without triggering alerts.
    
    This mirrors Affective.lean's wellbeing attestation liveness. -/

-- SECTION 8: SENSATION → AFFECTIVE MAPPING
-- ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

/-- Map sensation compound to affective urgency.
    
    This bridges Sensation (perception) to Affective (internal state).
    High distress + low safety → critical urgency. -/

  let raw_valence := comfort_contrib + distress_contrib
  -- Clamp to [-100, 100]
