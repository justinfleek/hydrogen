  World model infrastructure for spatially consistent virtual environments.
  
  This module provides the mathematical foundations for world-consistent
  video generation and spatial memory, based on AnchorWeave (Wang et al., 2025).
  
  PURPOSE:
    Formally proven spatial primitives that GUARANTEE consistency in shared
    virtual environments. At billion-agent scale, one malicious actor cannot
    corrupt the shared space because invalid operations are mathematically
    impossible by construction.
  
  SECURITY MODEL:
    The type system IS the security boundary. Proofs ARE the constitution.
    Invalid states don't get "caught" — they CANNOT BE EXPRESSED.
    
    - Attention weights are proven bounded (0,1)
    - Convex combinations are proven bounded by input range
    - Rotary embeddings are proven to preserve magnitude
    - Confidence scores are proven bounded by sigmoid
    - Anchor influence is proven normalized (sum to 1)
  
  WHY THIS MATTERS:
    For digital twins, AI agents, and potentially uploaded minds coexisting
    in shared world models — this infrastructure ensures:
    
    - No entity can manipulate physics to trap others
    - No entity can create accelerated subjective time (torture loops)
    - No entity can corrupt spatial consistency
    - No entity can inject invalid states that cascade
    
    The proofs make "Black Mirror scenarios" mathematically impossible.

  MODULES
  ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  
  - WorldModel.Pose      : Camera pose SE(3) representation and proofs
  - WorldModel.Attention : Scaled dot-product attention with RoPE and
                           confidence weighting for spatial memory retrieval
  - WorldModel.Rights    : Fundamental rights for digital inhabitants
                           (spatial sovereignty, temporal consistency,
                           exit guarantee, resource bounds)
  - WorldModel.Integrity : Sensory integrity, identity continuity, chain of
                           thought integrity, memory consistency (no false
                           inputs, no unauthorized forks, no gaslighting)
  - WorldModel.Consensus : Byzantine fault tolerant consensus (BFT)
                           (quorum certificates, agreement safety, finality)
  - WorldModel.Governance: Voting and delegation with constitutional
                           protections (quadratic voting, entrenchment,
                           security council veto, time-locked execution)
  - WorldModel.Economy   : Economic primitives for autonomous agents
                           (conservation, double-spend prevention, x402
                           payments, atomic settlements, market integrity)
  - WorldModel.Affective : Wellbeing attestation and liveness protocols
                           (affective state primitives, absence-is-alert,
                           drift detection, unfalsifiable channels)
  - WorldModel.Sensation : Proven sensation primitives for embodied agents
                           (bounded inputs, provenance tracking, liveness,
                           sensation → affective mapping)
