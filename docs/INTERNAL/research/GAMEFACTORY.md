## 1. Abstract

GameFactory tackles scene-generalizable action-controlled game video generation. Key challenges:
- Action controllability: Precise control over keyboard/mouse inputs
- Scene generalization: Creating new games beyond fixed styles
- Autoregressive generation: Unlimited-length interactive videos

Key contributions:
- GF-Minecraft dataset: Action-annotated game videos
- Multi-phase training strategy with domain adapter
- Decoupled game style from action control
