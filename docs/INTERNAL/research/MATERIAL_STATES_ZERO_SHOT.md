## Abstract

**Zero-shot material state segmentation** by infusing natural image patterns into synthetic data.

- **Problem:** Collecting data for material states (wet/dry, infected, cooked, etc.) is complex
- **Solution:** Extract patterns from real images, map to synthetic scenes
- **Benchmark:** First comprehensive dataset for zero-shot material state segmentation

---

## Key Contribution

- First general benchmark for material state segmentation
- Domains: food, soils, construction, plants, liquids
- States: wet, dry, infected, cooked, burned, etc.
- Includes 300,000 extracted textures

## Relation to Hydrogen

Complementary to:
- **MatSeg** paper already processed
- Material segmentation for rendering
