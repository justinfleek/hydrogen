## Abstract

Estimates **optimal cloth mesh resolution** without preliminary simulations using:

- **Material stiffness** → wrinkle wavelength/amplitude
- **Boundary conditions** → local wrinkle formation

Based on **Cerda and Mahadevan experimental theory**.

---

## Problem

- Too high resolution = wasted computation
- Too low resolution = missing fine wrinkle details

---

## Solution

Apply physics-based wrinkle theory to compute non-uniform mesh resolution tailored to fabric properties.

## Relation to Hydrogen

Complementary to:
- Cloth collision papers
- Material simulation
- Garment physics
