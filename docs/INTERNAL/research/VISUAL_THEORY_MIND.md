## Abstract

Multi-agent reinforcement learning testbed for emergent communication (**Signification Game**).

### Key Innovation

**Visual Theory of Mind** enables agents to:
- Communicate actions using pictographs
- Invent proto-writing systems

### Framework

- Inferential communication model
- Situated in animal communication formalism
- Sheds light on cognitive/cultural processes underlying proto-writing emergence

## Relation to Hydrogen

### Directly Relevant: Emergent Communication

Complementary to:
- **AI Mother Tongue** (MARL communication)
- **Large Population Models** (agent societies)

### Key Insight
How symbolic writing emerges from visual communication — relevant for understanding agent communication protocols.
