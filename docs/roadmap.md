## Playground Completion (AI Velocity Estimate)

Based on observed velocity (~80K LOC/day, ~$3K/day at current token costs), here's the estimate to complete the playground with full runtime targets:

| Component | LOC Est. | AI Hours | Notes |
|-----------|----------|----------|-------|
| Canvas Target | ~500 | 2-3h | 2D rendering, path drawing, compositing |
| WebGL/WebGPU bindings | ~1,500 | 4-6h | Shader compilation, buffer management, draw calls |
| Lottie integration | ~800 | 3-4h | JSON parsing, animation interpolation |
| Icon system | ~400 | 2h | SVG sprite handling, icon registry |
| Animation runtime loop | ~600 | 3-4h | requestAnimationFrame, spring physics |
| Playground runtime wiring | ~400 | 2-3h | Element → Target dispatch |
| Video/Audio players | ~1,300 | 5-7h | Media controls, streaming, sync |
| Map component | ~1,000 | 4-5h | Tile rendering, gestures, markers |
| 3D model viewer | ~1,200 | 5-6h | glTF loading, orbit controls, PBR |
| Code editor | ~1,500 | 5-6h | Syntax highlighting, line numbers, selection |
| Effects (blur, glow) | ~600 | 2-3h | WebGL post-processing |
| Reactive triggers | ~400 | 2-3h | Event → Msg wiring, debounce/throttle |
| Polish/a11y/tests | ~2,000 | 6-8h | ARIA, keyboard nav, test coverage |
| **Total** | **~12,200** | **40-60h** | **~2-3 days, ~$1-2K** |

### Velocity Context

The current codebase was built in approximately 4 days of AI development time:
- **316K LOC PureScript** (Schema, API, Render)
- **80 Lean proof files** (~1100 theorems)
- **Cost:** ~$3K in API tokens

This suggests the playground completion is well within a single focused sprint.
