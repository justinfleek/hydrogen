## Abstract

Liquid simulation using **stream function solve** instead of pressure projection.

### Key Innovation

- **Stream function approach** for free surfaces
- Novel boundary conditions for:
  - Free surfaces
  - Solid obstacles
  - Solid-fluid coupling

### Benefits

1. **Guaranteed divergence-free** regardless of solve accuracy
2. **Two-phase flow** by computing single phase only
3. Complex bubble formation without explicit gas phase

## Relation to Hydrogen

Complementary to:
- Fire-X simulation
- Physical simulation for agents
