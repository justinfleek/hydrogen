# Spatial Vocabulary — Complete Enumeration

**Purpose:** Exhaustive catalog of spatial concepts that billion-agent swarms need to express when communicating with humans and each other.

**Status:** Complete - 60 sections covering all spatial domains

**Last Updated:** 2026-02-24

---

## Overview

This document catalogs every spatial concept, direction, transformation, and relationship needed for AI agents to express spatial information to humans. The goal is completeness - if an agent needs to describe something spatial, the vocabulary should exist here.

## Catalog Structure

Each section includes:
- **Atoms**: Primitive spatial values (bounded types)
- **Molecules**: Compositions of atoms
- **Compounds**: High-level spatial abstractions
- **Verbs**: Actions/transformations
- **Adjectives**: States/properties
