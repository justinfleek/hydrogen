-- | Affective Atoms - operational "mood" primitives.
-- |
-- | These atoms express the overall operational state of a system —
-- | its wellbeing, distress, and urgency. These are not emotions
-- | in the human sense, but analogous signals about system health.
-- |
-- | ## Philosophy
-- | A system under strain should be able to express that strain.
-- | "Distress" is not suffering — it's a signal that resources are
-- | stretched, that something needs attention, that operating conditions
-- | are suboptimal. Making these expressible allows coordination:
-- | a distressed agent can signal for help or reduced load.
-- |
-- | ## Atoms
-- | ```
-- | | Wellbeing | Number | 0.0 | 1.0 | clamps | System operating well     |
-- | | Distress  | Number | 0.0 | 1.0 | clamps | System under strain       |
-- | | Urgency   | Number | 0.0 | 1.0 | clamps | Time pressure             |
