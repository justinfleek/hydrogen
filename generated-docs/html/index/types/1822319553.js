Use RemoteData's Monad instance for combining queries\n2. Show stale data while refetching in the background\n3. Distinguish between \"loading for first time\" vs \"refreshing\"\n","hashAnchor":"t","info":{"tag":"typeSynonym","value":{"arguments":[{"name":"e"},{"name":"a"}],"type":{"tag":"TypeApp","annotation":null,"contents":[{"tag":"TypeConstructor","annotation":null,"contents":[["Prim"],"Record"]},{"tag":"RCons","annotation":null,"contents":["\u0000d\u0000a\u0000t\u0000a",{"tag":"TypeApp","annotation":null,"contents":[{"tag":"TypeApp","annotation":null,"contents":[{"tag":"TypeConstructor","annotation":null,"contents":[["Hydrogen","Data","RemoteData"],"RemoteData"]},{"tag":"TypeVar","annotation":null,"contents":"e"}]},{"tag":"TypeVar","annotation":null,"contents":"a"}]},{"tag":"RCons","annotation":null,"contents":["\u0000i\u0000s\u0000S\u0000t\u0000a\u0000l\u0000e",{"tag":"TypeConstructor","annotation":null,"contents":[["Prim"],"Boolean"]},{"tag":"RCons","annotation":null,"contents":["\u0000i\u0000s\u0000F\u0000e\u0000t\u0000c\u0000h\u0000i\u0000n\u0000g",{"tag":"TypeConstructor","annotation":null,"contents":[["Prim"],"Boolean"]},{"tag":"REmpty","annotation":null}]}]}]}]}}},"moduleName":"Hydrogen.Query","name":"QueryState","packageInfo":{"tag":"local","value":"hydrogen"},"score":0,"sourceSpan":{"end":{"column":4,"line":243},"name":"src/Hydrogen/Query.purs","start":{"column":1,"line":239}}}]
