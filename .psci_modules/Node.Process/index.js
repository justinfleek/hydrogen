// | Args:
// | - `reason` <Error> | <any> The object with which the promise was rejected (typically an Error object).
// | - `promise` <Promise> The rejected promise.
// |
// | The 'unhandledRejection' event is emitted whenever a Promise is rejected and no error handler is attached to the promise within a turn of the event loop. When programming with Promises, exceptions are encapsulated as "rejected promises". Rejections can be caught and handled using promise.catch() and are propagated through a Promise chain. The 'unhandledRejection' event is useful for detecting and keeping track of promises that were rejected whose rejections have not yet been handled.
var unhandledRejectionH = /* #__PURE__ */ (function () {
    return new Node_EventEmitter.EventHandle("unhandledRejection", function (cb) {
        return function (a, b) {
            return cb(a)(b)();
        };
    });
})();

// | Args:
// | - `err` <Error> The uncaught exception.
// | - `origin` <string> Indicates if the exception originates from an unhandled rejection or from a synchronous error. 
// |    Can either be 'uncaughtException' or 'unhandledRejection'. 
// |    The latter is used when an exception happens in a Promise based async context (or if a Promise is rejected) 
// |    and `--unhandled-rejections` flag set to `strict` or `throw` (which is the default) and 
// |    the rejection is not handled, or when a rejection happens during the command line entry point's 
// |    ES module static loading phase.
// |
// | The 'uncaughtException' event is emitted when an uncaught JavaScript exception bubbles 
// | all the way back to the event loop. By default, Node.js handles such exceptions 
// | by printing the stack trace to `stderr` and exiting with code 1, 
// | overriding any previously set `process.exitCode`. 
// | Adding a handler for the 'uncaughtException' event overrides this default behavior. 
// | Alternatively, change the process.exitCode in the 'uncaughtException' handler which will 
// | result in the process exiting with the provided exit code. Otherwise, in the presence of 
// | such handler the process will exit with 0.
// |
// | 'uncaughtException' is a crude mechanism for exception handling intended to be used only as a last resort. The event should not be used as an equivalent to On Error Resume Next. Unhandled exceptions inherently mean that an application is in an undefined state. Attempting to resume application code without properly recovering from the exception can cause additional unforeseen and unpredictable issues.
// | 
// | Exceptions thrown from within the event handler will not be caught. Instead the process will exit with a non-zero exit code and the stack trace will be printed. This is to avoid infinite recursion.
// | 
// | Attempting to resume normally after an uncaught exception can be similar to pulling out the power cord when upgrading a computer. Nine out of ten times, nothing happens. But the tenth time, the system becomes corrupted.
// | 
// | The correct use of 'uncaughtException' is to perform synchronous cleanup of allocated resources (e.g. file descriptors, handles, etc) before shutting down the process. It is not safe to resume normal operation after 'uncaughtException'.
// | 
// | To restart a crashed application in a more reliable way, whether 'uncaughtException' is emitted or not, an external monitor should be employed in a separate process to detect application failures and recover or restart as needed.

// | The process.title property returns the current process title (i.e. returns the current value of ps). 
// | Assigning a new value to process.title modifies the current value of ps.
// | 
// | When a new value is assigned, different platforms will impose different maximum length restrictions 
// | on the title. Usually such restrictions are quite limited. For instance, on Linux and macOS, 
// | process.title is limited to the size of the binary name plus the length of the command-line arguments 
// | because setting the process.title overwrites the argv memory of the process. 
// | Node.js v0.8 allowed for longer process title strings by also overwriting the environ memory but 
// | that was potentially insecure and confusing in some (rather obscure) cases.

// | The 'rejectionHandled' event is emitted whenever a Promise has been rejected and an error handler was attached to it (using promise.catch(), for example) later than one turn of the Node.js event loop.

// | The Promise object would have previously been emitted in an 'unhandledRejection' event, but during the course of processing gained a rejection handler.
// | 
// | There is no notion of a top level for a Promise chain at which rejections can always be handled. Being inherently asynchronous in nature, a Promise rejection can be handled at a future point in time, possibly much later than the event loop turn it takes for the 'unhandledRejection' event to be emitted.
// | 
// | Another way of stating this is that, unlike in synchronous code where there is an ever-growing list of unhandled exceptions, with Promises there can be a growing-and-shrinking list of unhandled rejections.
// | 
// | In synchronous code, the 'uncaughtException' event is emitted when the list of unhandled exceptions grows.
// | 
// | In asynchronous code, the 'unhandledRejection' event is emitted when the list of unhandled rejections grows, and the 'rejectionHandled' event is emitted when the list of unhandled rejections shrinks.
